# Typescript - Jest - Webpack template

This branch is a simple typescript and jest setup:
ðŸŒ“Compatible to compile `.ts` and `.js` files (if you had previous work done in js).
ðŸ”¥TDD config out of the box, create your tests and start coding

For compilation to browser, see branch 2_Add_webpack

## Play around

- npm run test --> test!
- npx tsc --> transpile your ts (and js) to js!

A note, I also tested my transpiled code by running `node/main.js`, useful to see if the "production" code is ok.
