# Typescript - Jest - Webpack template

ğŸŒ“Compatible to compile `.ts` and `.js` files (if you had previous work done in js)
ğŸ”¥TDD config out of the box, create your tests in \***\*tests\*\*** folder and start coding.
ğŸŒŸBuild a bundle.js and deliver to web

This setup uses three.js as a 3rd party package. The idea was to learn how to include this package.

## Play around

- npm run test --> test!
- npm run build --> create your bundle (mode is in production and size got reduced to half compared to development mode)
- npm run dev --> see your changesğŸ‘€
